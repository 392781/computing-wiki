# University Computing Resources

UCSB has a number of cluster nodes available for research use that are managed by the Center for Scientific Computing (CSC).  These are shared through the whole university where participants buy nodes for the cluster while CSC provides all the infrastructure needed for smooth operations.

{: .note }
This is a cheaper alternative for private cluster nodes to be used by research labs or individuals through grants or personal funding.  If you need more compute than what PSTAT provides, consider this option!
