# University Computing Resources

UCSB has a number of cluster nodes available for research use that are managed by the Center for Scientific Computing (CSC) at the California NanoSystem Institute (CNSI). These nodes come in two forms:
- A simple application describing your work that gives you access to a shared batch computing environment
- A buy-in by a principal investigator at an economical rate (compared to private options)

Some useful information about this system as well as contact information for CSC:
